            <p>Our mission with this tool is to make it more convenient for the user to visualize what they want their Voron color theme to look like. Users can now create and visualize everything from the default four color groups (primary and accent color + chain and frame) to a very unique looking build, where up to 8 different groups of parts can be colored.</p>
